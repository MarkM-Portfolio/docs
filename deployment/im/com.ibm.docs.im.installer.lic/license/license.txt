Limited use right

As described in the Master License Agreement and this License Information, HCL grants Licensee a limited right to use the Program. This right is limited to the level of Authorized Use, such as a Processor Value Unit ("PVU"), a Resource Value Unit ("RVU"), a Value Unit ("VU"), or other specified level of use, paid for by Licensee as evidenced in the Proof of Entitlement. Licensee's use may also be limited to a specified machine, or only as a Supporting Program, or subject to other restrictions. As Licensee has not paid for all of the economic value of the Program, no other use is permitted without the payment of additional fees. In addition, Licensee is not authorized to use the Program to provide commercial IT services to any third party, to provide commercial hosting or timesharing, or to sublicense, rent, or lease the Program unless expressly provided for in the applicable agreements under which Licensee obtains authorizations to use the Program.

HCL reserves the right to determine whether to make such additional rights available to Licensee.

Supporting Programs

The Program is licensed as a multi-product package and includes the Supporting Programs identified below. Licensee is authorized to install and use such Supporting Programs only to support Licensee's use of the Principal Program under this Agreement and within the limits of the Proofs of Entitlement for the Program (unless broader rights are provided elsewhere in this License Information document). The phrase "to support Licensee's use" would include only those uses that are necessary or otherwise directly related to a licensed use of the Principal Program or another Supporting or Bundled Program. The Supporting Programs may not be used for any other purpose. Licensee is not authorized to transfer or remarket the Supporting Programs separate from the Principal Program. A Supporting Program may be accompanied by license terms, and those terms, if any, apply to Licensee's use of that Supporting Program. In the event of conflict, the terms in this License Information document supersede the Supporting Program's terms. When Licensee's right to use the Program expires or terminates, Licensee must discontinue use, destroy or promptly return all copies of the Supporting Programs to the party from whom Licensee acquired the Program. If Licensee downloaded the Supporting Programs, Licensee should contact the party from whom Licensee acquired the Program. If Licensee wishes to license the Supporting Programs for any use beyond the limits set forth above, please contact an HCL Sales Representative or the party from whom Licensee acquired the Program to obtain the appropriate license.

Terms for Oracle Outside In Technology

The Programs licensed under this Agreement include Outside In filtering and document viewing technology (the "Outside In Technology") supplied by Oracle USA, Inc. ("Oracle"). The term "Outside In Technology" includes any technology licensed to Oracle by its suppliers. As used in the Agreement, the term "HCL supplier" shall be deemed to include Oracle and its suppliers. In addition to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as a condition of using the Outside In Technology, Licensee specifically agrees as follows:

(1) Oracle USA, Inc. is a third party beneficiary to this Agreement.

(2) Licensee may only transfer the Program by providing advance written notice to HCL and otherwise subject to the terms of this Agreement.

(3) Licensee may not publish the results of benchmark tests run on the Outside In Technology without prior written permission.

(4) HCL may inform HCL suppliers of compliance verification results relating to such HCL suppliers' components.

(5) To the extent allowed under applicable law, the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act ("UCITA") does not apply.

Authorized User

Authorized User is a unit of measure by which the Program can be licensed. An Authorized User is a unique person who is given access to the Program. The Program may be installed on any number of computers or servers and each Authorized User may have simultaneous access to any number of instances of the Program at one time. Licensee must obtain separate, dedicated entitlements for each Authorized User given access to the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a multiplexing program, device, or application server) through any means. An entitlement for an Authorized User is unique to that Authorized User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the permanent transfer of the Authorized User entitlement to another person.

Program-unique Terms

Supporting Program Details

IBM DB2
- Entitlement: Ratio 1 PVU/1 PVU
- Use Limitations: Use by Principal Program

"Ratio n/m" means that Licensee receives some number ('n') entitlements for the Supporting Program for every specified number ('m') entitlements of the Principal Program as a whole. Unless otherwise specified, the number of entitlements for the Supporting Program is rounded up to a multiple of 'n'. For example, if a Program includes 100 PVUs for a Supporting Program for every 500 PVUs obtained of the Principal Program and Licensee acquires 1,200 PVUs of the Program, Licensee may install the Supporting Program and have processor cores available to or managed by it of up to 300 PVUs. Those PVUs would not need to be counted as part of the total PVU requirement for Licensee's installation of the Program on account of the installation of the Supporting Program (although those PVUs might need to be counted for other reasons, such as the processor cores being made available to the Principal Program, as well).

"Use by Principal Program" means that the Supporting Program is provided exclusively for use by the Principal Program. Neither Licensee nor any application, programmer device is authorized to directly use or access the services of the Supporting Program except Licensee may access the Supporting Program to perform administrative functions for the Supporting Program such as backup, recovery and authorized configuration
