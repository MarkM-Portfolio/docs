Steps to create Oracle database for HCL Docs

1. Log in with the same user ID that you used to install the Oracle database system, usually Administrator
2. Start Windows command line window
3. Set the ORACLE_SID, like "set ORACLE_SID=idocs", idocs is the oracle SID when you create Oracle database for HCL Docs, following our WIKI guide

 a) Run createDb.bat|sh to create database scheme
 b) Run dropDb.bat|sh to drop database scheme completely
 c) Run updateDBSchema.bat|sh to apply the DB migration of IBM docs, that is to apply the fixupN.sqls, based on your current DB scheme
 
Notes: 

 i) Please be attention that in 3.a, you will be asked to input database password for Oracle user DOCSUSER, this password will be used as database password during Docs installation.
 ii) The createDb.sh script needs dos2unix command and write permission to your directory.
