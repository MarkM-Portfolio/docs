The python below should run with the root
Check Routing Policy from Docs Tab on DPUI, if the value is "Dynamic Routing" or "is Docs Multiactive" is true, follow the guide as below

-------
Patch/restart Docs server
For MA & non-MA 
-------
Step for docs1a:
  Part I: Drop the Docs server from F5 and all Docs Proxy servers
    1. Forced Offline docs1a from F5(GZ) in side specific pool
    2. login to any of the docsrp server of the same side as docs1a(such as docsrp1a), run cmd as below:
	   cd /opt/ll/scripts/docsrp/
       python manageZkNodes.py --action inactivating --node docs1a
  Part II: apply patch/restart to docs1a
  Part III: Enable the Docs server from F5 and all Docs Proxy servers
    1. login to any of the docsrp server of the same side as docs1a(such as docsrp1a), run cmd as below:
	   cd /opt/ll/scripts/docsrp/
       a. run script to make sure it return active
	      python manageZkNodes.py --status --node docs1a --side A
       b. if docs1a is not active, login to docsrp1a, go to the folder that has manageZkNodes.py, run script and make sure it is succeed
          python manageZkNodes.py --action active --node docs1a
	2. enable docs1a from F5(GZ) in side specific pool

-------
If docsrp also need to be drop from F5, such as high cpu which need restart
Patch Docs proxy server
-------
For non MA
    Forced Offline docsrp from F5(YZ) in side specific pool
For MA
    Forced Offline docsrp from F5(YZ) in engage pool. 
	PAY ATTENTION!!!Should operate in engage pool of F5 instead of side specific pool
	
------
Drain Traffic of all the docs server of one side when MA
------
1. ManageMulti on dpui server to disable the docs component of specific side
    cd /opt/ll/lib/f5
    python manageMulti.py --environment=MA1 --component=docs --side=B --disable
2. Login to one of docsrp server, prepare python to set data center updating and wait for inactive
    cd /opt/ll/scripts/docsrp/
    python manageZkNodes.py --action upgrading --side B
	
	
------
If you upgrading the wrong side A, roll back as below:
------
1. Login to one of docsrp server, prepare python to set data center updating and wait for inactive
    cd /opt/ll/scripts/docsrp/
    python manageZkNodes.py --action active --side A
    python manageZkNodes.py --action active --node all --side A
2. ManageMulti on dpui server to enable the docs component of specific side
    cd /opt/ll/lib/f5
    python manageMulti.py --environment=MA1 --component=docs --side=B --enable
    

------
Check LOG to verify inactivating docs server or upgrading data center is ok
------
1. inactivating docs server
Docs server log should contains string as
"is now in inactivating status" which means docs server start to drain
"Start to set inactive" which means docs server has drained completely

2. upgrading data center
2.1 Check all the docsrp server's log, only one docsrp server contains log
"Now Data center xxx status is upgrading"
xxx should be the topolgoy name

2.2 The other docsrp server, should contains log 
either
"Now Data center xxx status is inactive" or "Do not need to upgrading data center" 
which means the side has already been set to inactive by other rp, no further action needed
or
"Have not require the data center upgrading" which means the current rp have not acquire the mutex and will do nothing

2.3 
Log contains
"even though some of the server still have not drained completely" 
means the docs server have not drained completely, but time out(default 5min) when upgrading side, so set side to inactive directly
while docs server should continue drain the traffic until done. "Start to set inactive" of the docs server indicate that drain is done.

2.4 Should also check the docs server inactivating log as above 1. inactivating docs server
