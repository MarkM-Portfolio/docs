# For example, users are accessing HCL Connections using "https://connections.renovations.com/files",
# while, using "https://docs.renovations.com/docs" for HCL Docs, and you enable communities application
# as ajax proxy for HCL Docs, then the value below should be:
# docs_url_prefix=https://docs.renovations.com/docs

# it is ONLY used for a special deployment topology
docs_url_prefix=/docs

# For some pilot usage, there are requirements to just enable HCL Docs for members in one or more Connections community
# For users who are not member of the specified communities, they will not see the extensions for HCL Docs on Connections UI

# Uncomment below line and make the value as "true" if you want to enable the entitlement check for extensions.
