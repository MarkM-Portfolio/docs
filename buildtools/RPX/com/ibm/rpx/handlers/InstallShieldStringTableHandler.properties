title = Install Shield String Table
description = Translates InstallShield installer string table files.  Only lines containing one or more tabs are translated with any text before the first tab or after a second or subsequent tab being left alone--only text following the first tab (and before any second tab) is translated.  Font definitions beginning with a curly brace followed by an ampersand ({&) and ending with a curly brace (}) are not translated.  Replacement variables beginning beginning and ending with square brackets ([]) are not translated.
