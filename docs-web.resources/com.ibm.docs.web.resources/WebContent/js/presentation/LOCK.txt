Lock explain 

---------------------

1. Slide or Element can have a user list, element can only be locked by one person
2. When user load document, user may get an element lock table from server, and initial a locker object with it.
3. UserJoined -> "/scene/user/joined" -> SlideEditor send lock out + Sorter send slide out.
              -> "requestLockStatus" -> Ask other user send yours to me. (Just in case the user joined is not called in other user side)
4. CoeditStarted -> "/scene/coedit/started" -> SlideEditor send lock out + Sorter send slide out. 
                 -> "requestLockStatus" -> Ask other user send yours to me. (3 + 4 is a double safe)
5. Leave    -> send remove lock from me message.
6. UserLeft -> remove the user from local lock. (5 + 6 is a double safe)

Lock OT

1. Server will lock box for Who take lock first, ignore the later lock request
2. The later user will receive lock message from the earlier, then exit edit mode and unlock the box in UI.
